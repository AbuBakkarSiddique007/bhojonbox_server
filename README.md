## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
- npm or pnpm

---

### 1. Clone the repositories

You can clone both repos (client and server) separately:

```bash
# Client
git clone https://github.com/AbuBakkarSiddique007/bhojonbox_client.git

# Server
git clone https://github.com/AbuBakkarSiddique007/bhojonbox_server.git
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd bhojonbox_server
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `bhojonbox_server/`:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/BhojonBox"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT=5000
```

Run database migrations and seed admin (development):

```bash
cd bhojonbox_server
pnpx prisma migrate dev --name init
pnpx prisma generate
# run the project seed script
pnpm run seed
```

Start the server in development:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5000 (by default)
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd bhojonbox_client
pnpm install
```

Client configuration

The client reads the API base URL from `bhojonbox_client/src/config.ts`. Edit that file if you need to point the client to a different backend URL (for local dev use `http://localhost:5000/api`, for production use `https://bhojonbox-server.onrender.com/api`).

Start the client development server:

```bash
cd bhojonbox_client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```
